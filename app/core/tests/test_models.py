# 'from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model' helper function that comes with Django.
# You can import the user model directly from the models but this is not recommended with django because at some
# point in the project you may want to change what your user model is and if
# everything is using the get user model function then that's really easy to do
# because you just change it in the settings instead of having to change all the references to the user model.
